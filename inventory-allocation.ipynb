    "# Inventory Allocation Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides two prototypes of solvers for the inventory allocation problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "We use the problem statements that are essentially equivalent to the classic *linear transportation problem*:\n",
    "  * The first prototype focuses on the basic formulation where a single product (SKU) needs to be allocated across $n$ warehouses to serve $m$ markets. \n",
    "  * The second prototype focuses on an extended formulation of the problem where some product combinations are frequently purchased together. In this formulation, we need to ensure that such combinations (itemsets) are collocated so that orders are not split across multiple warehouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prototype: Approach and Data\n",
    "We formulate the inventory optimization problem as a linear programming (LP) task and use the off-the-shelf solver to find a solution. We use a small supply chain topology (cost matrices) defined inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage and Productization\n",
    "The first prototype has reasonably good scalability and can be applied to relatively large topologies. The second prototype makes more realistic assumptions about the demand structure, but requires to specify the itemsets. Such itemsets can be learned using the *market basket analysis* algorithms.  "
